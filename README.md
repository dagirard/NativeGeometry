NativeGeometry
-----------------------------------------------
NativeGeometry is an enhanced geometry manager for LiveCode.

NativeGeometry allows you to create quickly a complex and localizable graphical user interface, that is as fast as your own script and with the ease of use of the built-in LiveCode Geometry manager!

# How to get started?

Download the repository, and extract it to your LiveCode extension folder.

You can locate the user extensions folder by doing so:
1. Open LiveCode preferences
2. In the Files & Memory preferences pane you can find the full path to the User Extensions folder. 
3. Open this folder in your system file browser.
4. If it doesn't exists, create a **"Plugins"** subfolder.
5. Extract NativeGeometry into the **"Plugins"** subfolder.
6. Start LiveCode and the NativeGeometry plugin window will be displayed

**Make sure that "rev_NativeGeometry_Launcher.rev" file is at the root of the Plugins folder, LiveCode will automatically execute this file that will load NativeGeometry.**

# Documentation

Once NativeGeometry is opened, click "Help Center".

# Embeed NativeGeometry in your application

You need to embeed the stack "NativeGeometry.res\System\NativeGeometry.rev" within your application, or dynamically load it.

Then call in your initialization procedure:
`open invisible stack "NativeGeometry"`

# Tests

NativeGeometry doesn't have an automated test suite. For each release a set of manual tests cases need to be executed.

You can find some tests stack under the `NativeGeometry.res\Devel\Tester\` folder.

# How to contribute?

The workflow is a typical git workflow, where contributors fork the [dagirard/NativeGeometry](https://github.com/dagirard/NativeGeometry) repository, make their changes on a branch, and then submit a pull request.

**Note:** Before a push request can be made, you will have to perform manual tests with NativeGeometry, and mark them as you didn't introduced a regression.
